# Raspberry Pi5 bootloader EEPROM release notes

2023-09-13: Initial release

* Initial manufacturing software
* Network Install is not available in this version
* rpi-eeprom-update uses self-update on Pi5 rather than recovery.bin.
  so that the update mechanism is the same on all boot-modes and the
  boot file-system is never modified by the firmware/recovery.bin.
  recovery.bin is still used by RPi Imager - bootloader update SD card images.
* Pi4 and Pi4 bootloader images and recovery.bin are not compatible.
  The 2711/2712 boot ROM ignores incompatible recovery.bin files.
